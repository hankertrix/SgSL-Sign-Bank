# Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) Sign Bank

Welcome to the unofficial and community-maintained
sign bank for Singapore Sign Language (SgSL)!
This sign bank aims to be the ultimate resource
for Singapore Sign Language.
Hopefully you will find this repository useful
in learning Singapore Sign Language.

## Accessing the sign bank

[Click here](./sign-bank/sign-bank.org) to view the sign bank.

<!-- You can also view the sign bank -->
<!-- through a specially built website if the -->
<!-- sign bank on GitHub loads too slowly. Access it -->
<!-- [here](https://sgsl-sign-bank.vercel.app). -->

Alternatively, you can download a local
copy of the sign bank if you find it
loading too slowly for your liking.
You can download a local copy from
[here](https://github.com/hankertrix/SgSL-Sign-Bank/releases/latest/) or
[here](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhankertrix%2FSgSL-Sign-Bank%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fsign-bank).
The latter takes much longer to download,
so it is recommended to download the sign
bank directly from GitHub using the first link.
Open the file ending in `.html`
to view the sign bank in your browser.

## Background

This used to be a cheat sheet for the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
module LL5001 Singapore Sign Language Level 1.
It was migrated to a separate repository as the list of signs inside
the cheat sheet had grown to be more comprehensive than even the
[SgSL Sign Bank] maintained by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and
The Singapore Association for the Deaf (SADeaf).
Moving the cheat sheet into a separate
repository will make it easier to maintain
and for people to contribute.

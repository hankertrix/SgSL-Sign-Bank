# [Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) Sign Bank][Website]

Welcome to the unofficial and community-maintained sign bank for
Singapore Sign Language (SgSL)!
This sign bank aims to be the ultimate resource for Singapore Sign Language.
Hopefully you will find this repository useful for
learning Singapore Sign Language.

## [Website]

The website is built using the [Astro] meta-framework and
uses only [Astro components][astro-components],
and does not make use of other additional front-end frameworks like
[React], [Vue], [Solid], or [Svelte].
It also makes use of [Pagefind] for website search.

Visit the [website here][Website].

## Issues and contributions

If you find any errors in the sign bank, or would like to contribute
a sign or a sord (the sign equivalent for a word),
feel free to open an issue or a pull request in this repository.

Alternatively, you can also contact

## Background

This used to be a cheat sheet for the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
module LL5001 Singapore Sign Language Level 1.
It was migrated to a separate repository as the list of signs inside
the cheat sheet had grown to be more comprehensive than even the
[SgSL Sign Bank] maintained by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and
The Singapore Association for the Deaf (SADeaf).
Moving the cheat sheet into a separate repository will make it
easier to maintain, and easier for people to contribute.
Hence, this sign bank for SgSL was born.

Previously, before the [website][Website] was created, the sign bank
was in the form of a downloadable HTML file which was created from an
Org mode document. That has since been removed as the website
is far easier to use and maintain.

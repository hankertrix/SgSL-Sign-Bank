## How to communicate with Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individuals

### One-on-one situation

- Get the deaf person's attention before speaking.
  Call out the person's name.
  If that is not successful,
  a tap on the shoulder, a wave,
  or another visual signal usually does the trick.
- Speak slowly and clearly but don't yell, exaggerate or over pronounce.
- Look directly at the deaf person when speaking.
- Don't place anything in your mouth when speaking such as chewing gum.
- Avoid standing in front of a light source such as a window or a light bulb.
- Be courteous to the deaf person during conversation.
  If the telephone or doorbell rings,
  excuse yourself and tell the deaf person
  you are answering the phone or the door.

### In a group with deaf people, like in a class or meeting

- Ask the deaf person to choose the best seating for communication.
  They will know where to sit.
- Provide new vocabulary in advance.
- Use visual aids.
- Slow down the pace of communication slightly.
- Allow full participation by looking out for deaf people who have questions.
- Repeat questions if the deaf people look doubtful.

### Using an interpreter

- Use a specialised academic or educational interpreter.
- Abide by the code of ethics to ensure accurate communication
  between people who have different language needs,
  as effective professional practice requires both parties
  to have a clear understanding of each other.
- Treat the interpreter as a professional.
- Speak directly to the deaf person, and not the interpreter.
- Don't use "tell him / her" when using an interpreter.

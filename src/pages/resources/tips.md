## How to communicate with Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individuals

### One-on-one situation

- Get the deaf person's attention before speaking.
  Call out the person's name.
  If that is not successful,
  a tap on the shoulder, a wave,
  or another visual signal usually does the trick.
- Speak slowly and clearly but don't yell, exaggerate or over pronounce.
- Look directly at the deaf person when speaking.
- Don't place anything in your mouth when speaking such as chewing gum.
- Avoid standing in front of a light source such as a window or a light bulb.
- Be courteous to the deaf person during conversation.
  If the telephone or doorbell rings,
  excuse yourself and tell the deaf person
  you are answering the phone or the door.

### In a group with deaf people, like in a class or meeting

- Ask the deaf person to choose the best seating for communication.
  They will know where to sit.
- Provide new vocabulary in advance.
- Use visual aids.
- Slow down the pace of communication slightly.
- Allow full participation by looking out for deaf people who have questions.
- Repeat questions if the deaf people look doubtful.

### Using an interpreter

- Use a specialised academic or educational interpreter.
- Abide by the code of ethics to ensure accurate communication
  between people who have different language needs,
  as effective professional practice requires both parties
  to have a clear understanding of each other.
- Treat the interpreter as a professional.
- Speak directly to the deaf person, and not the interpreter.
- Don't use "tell him / her" when using an interpreter.

## How to sign more like a native?

- Make your signs as small as reasonably possible.
  Particularly, you should aim to minimise the width of your signs.
- When signing numbers with a [zero](../signs/zero),
  you can just close your fingers into a zero straight away and
  not need to move your hand to the right when signing the zero.
- When signing numbers with a [hundred](../signs/100) in them,
  you can move the "C" backwards instead of to the right.

### Finger spelling tips

- Finger spell from left to right.
- Finger spell within the area between your shoulders.
- Start your finger spelling from below your chin.
- Spell smoothly and do not bounce or
  move your hand up and down when spelling.
- Relax your hand and wrists, don't strain your wrist.

## How to introduce yourself to a Deaf person?

When introducing yourself to a Deaf person, be prepared
to include the following in your introduction.

- Your first name and last name.
- Whether you are deaf, hard of hearing, or hearing.
- Who is teaching you the language and culture.
- Where you are studying.
- Why you are learning the language.

## How to leave a deaf event?

Do let the deaf people or organiser know that you are leaving.
You are not being obnoxious, but are instead being polite as they
cannot hear you leaving the room.

The agent gesture is to show a box with both hands and move the box down.

This is the exact same gesture as
the first variation of ["person"](../signs/person#variation-1).

This gesture used to turn change an action, into a person doing the action.
For example, teach + agent gesture = teacher.

## "Wh" facial expression

This expression is usually used when asking a question,
and can be shown as "furrowing" the eyebrows a bit,
with the head tilted slightly backwards,
and the body leaning towards the respondent.

## Signing area

The signing area refers to the area from the top of your head
to the bottom of your waist. The width of that area is shoulder width.

## Initialised sign

An initialised sign is a sign that uses a letter of the English alphabet
in its gesture, usually the first letter of the word.

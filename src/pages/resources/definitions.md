## Agent gesture

The agent gesture is to show a box with both hands and move the box down.

![Agent gesture](@signs/person-variation-1.gif)

This is the exact same gesture as
the first variation of ["person"](../signs/person#variation-1).

This gesture used to turn change an action, into a person doing the action.
For example, teach + agent gesture = teacher.

## "Wh" facial expression

This expression is usually used when asking a question,
and can be shown as "furrowing" the eyebrows a bit,
with the head tilted slightly backwards,
and the body leaning towards the respondent.

## Dominant hand

The dominant hand is the hand that you will naturally use more often.
It will be your right hand if you are right-handed,
and your left hand if you are left-handed.

## Signing area

The signing area refers to the area from the top of your head
to the bottom of your waist. The width of that area is shoulder width.

## Initialised sign

An initialised sign is a sign that uses a letter of the English alphabet
in its gesture, usually the first letter of the word.

## Sord

A sord is the sign language equivalent of a word.

## Root of signs

The root of a sign is another sign or gesture that is used as the base
for the sign. For example, the root of the signs for
["read"](../signs/read) and ["study"](../signs/study) is "book".
Another example is ["sit"](../signs/sit) being the root for
["chair"](../signs/chair) and ["couch"](../signs/couch).

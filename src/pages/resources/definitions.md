## Agent gesture

The agent gesture is to show a box with both hands and move the box down.

![Agent gesture](@signs/person-variation-1.gif)

This is the exact same gesture as
the first variation of ["person"](../signs/person#variation-1).

This gesture used to turn change an action, into a person doing the action.
For example, teach + agent gesture = teacher.

## "Wh" facial expression

This expression is usually used when asking a question,
and can be shown as "furrowing" the eyebrows a bit,
with the head tilted slightly backwards,
and the body leaning towards the respondent.

## Dominant hand

The dominant hand is the hand that you will naturally use more often.
It will be your right hand if you are right-handed,
and your left hand if you are left-handed.

## Signing area

The signing area refers to the area from the top of your head
to the bottom of your waist. The width of that area is shoulder width.

## Initialised sign

An initialised sign is a sign that uses a letter of the English alphabet
in its gesture, usually the first letter of the word.

## Sord

A sord is the sign language equivalent of a word.

## Gloss

Gloss is a way of writing English to translate
Singapore Sign Language signs to words.
It is called glossing because it is not a full translation,
as English does not have words to describe some signs
in Singapore Sign Language.

## Root of signs

The root of a sign is another sign or gesture that is used as the base
for the sign. For example, the root of the signs for
["read"](../signs/read) and ["study"](../signs/study) is "book".
Another example is ["sit"](../signs/sit) being the root for
["chair"](../signs/chair) and ["couch"](../signs/couch).

## Non-manual markers (NMM) / Non-manual signals or signs (NMS)

Non-manual markers or non-manual signals or signs encompass essentially
everything that isn't done by your hands, as all signs and gestures
done by your hands are considered manual. That means non-manual markers
consist of body language and physical actions, such as:

- Head shake or nod
- Head tilts
- Raised eyebrows
- Pursed lips
- Movement of the tongue
- Movement of the chin
- Eye shifts and gazes
- Body shifts and movements
- Facial expressions, like smiling, frowning, angry look, puzzled look, etc.

These signals must be clear and obvious for the meaning to be understood.

### Examples of non-manual markers

1. Not yet or haven't

   Slightly opening the mouth and placing the tongue over the bottom teeth
   so that it touches the lower lip.

2. Boring

   Mouth yawning or puffing out your cheeks and moving your eyes.

3. I never hear

   Eyebrows frowning or one eyebrow raising.

4. Really

   Show facial expression like something is incredible,
   or a questioning look, depending on what you mean.

5. Long-winded

   Eyes drooping and tongue wagging.

6. Exhausted

   Puffing out your cheeks and show arms drooping.

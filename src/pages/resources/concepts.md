## Tense markers

- Time in sign language is not indicated through tenses,
  and the verbs in sign language do not change in form when tenses change.
- For example the sign for "eat" and "ate" are the same.
- Time is therefore indicated through the use of adverbs of time.

## Intensity of signs

Intensity is shown by varying the speed, size, and force
with which a sign is made, increasing the number of repetitions of a gesture,
or by incorporating facial expressions.
For example:

1. Walk can be made quickly or slowly to indicate how the person is walking.
2. Drink can be modified depending on the volume consumed.
3. Smart becomes brilliant when the sign is exaggerated.
4. Pretty becomes beautiful when the sign is exaggerated.
5. What becomes WHAT by moving your index finger across your body instead
   of just across your palm.
6. Need becomes must when the gesture is done with more force.
7. Indicating how many times you have told a person something
   by repeating the gesture and then counting up the number of times
   it has been told.

## Letter drag

You can drag out letters at the end of a finger spell only if
the ending letters are the same.
The motion is like pulling the letter out to the side.

You cannot do a letter drag for duplicate letters at the start
or the middle of a word, only at the end.

## Plural words

Plural words are denoted by repeating the sign once more.

## Nouns from verbs

Usually, the noun form of a word is just the verb form done twice.

## Classifiers (CL)

### How is a classifier different from a hand shape?

Hand shapes are one of the 5 fundamental building blocks or
parameters of a sign, which are:

- Hand shape
- Movement
- Location
- Orientation
- Non-manual markers

Those 5 parameters are the _basic_ categories. You can divide
"non-manual markers" or other parameters into several smaller categories,
but there are still 5 **main** parameters. Non-manual markers include
the aspects of body language that do not involve the hands,
such as shoulder movements, head tilts, and facial expression.

Classifiers are designated hand shapes and rule-grounded body
pantomime used to represent nouns and verbs. The purpose of the classifier
is to provide additional information about nouns and verbs such as:

- Location
- Kind of action
- Size
- Shape
- Manner

Sign language has many classifier hand shapes to represent specific categories
or class of objects.

The hand shape of a sign is literally the shape in which
we form our hand during the production of a sign. All signs have a hand shape.

Classifiers are signs which use hand shapes that are associated
with specific categories or classes of size, shape, or usage.

### Uses

Classifiers can help to clarify your message, highlight specific details,
and provide an efficient way of conveying information.

Classifiers can be used to:

- Describe the size and shape of an object.
- Represent the object itself.
- Demonstrate how the object moves.
- Convey how it relates to other objects and or people.

### Basic rules

- To designate the referent of a classifier, a signer must either finger spell
  or sign the referent before the classifier can be used.
- To choose an appropriate classifier, there must be a relationship
  between the referent and the descriptive nature of that specific classifier.

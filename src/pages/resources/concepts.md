## Tense markers

- Time in sign language is not indicated through tenses,
  and the verbs in sign language do not change in form when tenses change.
- For example the sign for "eat" and "ate" are the same.
- Time is therefore indicated through the use of adverbs of time.

## Intensity of signs

Intensity is shown by varying the intensity or speed
with which a sign is made, or by incorporating facial expressions.
For example:

1. Walk can be made quickly or slowly to indicate how the person is walking.
2. Drink can be modified depending on the volume consumed.
3. Smart becomes brilliant when the sign is exaggerated.
4. Pretty becomes beautiful when the sign is exaggerated.

## Letter drag

You can drag out letters at the end of a finger spell only if
the ending letters are the same.
The motion is like pulling the letter out to the side.

You cannot do a letter drag for duplicate letters at the start
or the middle of a word, only at the end.

## Plural words

Plural words are denoted by repeating the sign once more.

## Nouns from verbs

Usually, the noun form of a word is just the verb form done twice.

## General information

- Sign language is not universal since language is derived from culture,
  which varies from country to country.
- Today, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) is recognised as the sign language
  used by the Singaporean Deaf Community.
- Historically, SgSL it is related to Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL)
  and American Sign Language (ASL), while heavily influenced by manually
  coded English such as Signing Exact English (SEE) and Signed English.
- In 2006, New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL) became the official sign language
  of New Zealand after the second official language, Maori.

## Inappropriate terms

The following terms should _never be used_ because they are outdated
and extremely offensive.

### Deaf and dumb

A deaf person is not dumb. Deaf people are the same as other people,
except that they cannot hear.

### Deaf and mute

A person who is mute is unable to talk.
Deaf people have functioning vocal cords.
In fact, some have very good speech.

### Normal

Do not use the term "normal" to contrast Deaf and hard-of-hearing people
with those who are not. Use the terms "hearing people" or "hearing" instead.

## Modes of communication

There are 2 modes of communication.

### Oral communication

People who are educated and trained in the auditory-oral approach
can be trained to listen and speak. However, the success of this approach
depends on the following factors:

1. Residual hearing of the deaf person.
2. Intensity of the auditory and speech sessions.
3. Family support.
4. Individual ability and talent.

### Manual communication

This refers to the use of any sign languages and gestures used by the
Deaf person to communicate with others.

## UN models of disability

The video below gives an amazing analogy for the different models
of disability.

### Charity

- Agency of persons-with-disabilities:

  Persons-with-disabilities are passive objects
  of kind acts and welfare payments.

- How persons-with-disabilities are viewed:

  Persons-with-disabilities are targets of pity.

- Equality and inclusion:

  Persons-with-disabilities are regarded as occupying a separate social space.

### Medical

- Agency of persons-with-disabilities:

  Experts such as doctors, psychiatrists and nurses have extensive
  power over the person.

- How persons-with-disabilities are viewed:

  Persons-with-disabilities are "abnormal" and can be "fixed"
  through medicine or rehabilitation to become "normal".

- Equality and inclusion:

  Persons-with-disabilities are regarded as "abnormal"
  and are to be kept away from society.

#### In context of the Deaf community

- Deafness is medical problem concerning the ears.
- Language delay due to problems with speech.
- Rehabilitate or train deaf people to be like hearing people,
  by normalising or curing them.
- Use technology to improve or treat hearing problems.

### Social or cultural

- Agency of persons-with-disabilities:

  Society should respond to the expectation of the
  persons-with-disabilities, not to those of the institution.

- How persons-with-disabilities are viewed:

  Persons-with-disabilities can be empowered, in control of their lives
  and enjoy full participation if the society is accepting.

- Equality and inclusion:

  Inequality is not due to the impairment, but to the inability
  of society to eliminate barriers challenging persons-with-disabilities.

#### In context of the Deaf community

- Being Deaf is okay. It is not an illness,
  and it does not need to be fixed by technology.
- Deaf people have the right to use their own language.
- Deaf behaviour and ways are of a different culture, **not** "abnormal".
- Deaf people are a natural community,
  not just individuals with hearing problems.

### Human rights

- Agency of persons-with-disabilities:

  Persons-with-disabilities are the subjects of rights,
  and others, such as the State, have the responsibility
  to respect these persons with the help of the law.

- How persons-with-disabilities are viewed:

  Assistance given to persons-with-disabilities is not driven by
  compassion, but by dignity and respect.

- Equality and inclusion:

  The society seeks to assist persons-with-disabilities to help themselves
  so that they can participate in society.

## How to sign more like a native Deaf signer?

- Make your signs as small as reasonably possible.
  Particularly, you should aim to minimise the width of your signs.
- When signing numbers with a [zero](../signs/zero),
  you can just close your fingers into a zero straight away and
  not need to move your hand to the right when signing the zero.
- When signing numbers with a [hundred](../signs/100) in them,
  you can move the "C" backwards instead of to the right.
- Maintain constant eye contact with the other person when conversing.

### Finger spelling tips

- Finger spell from left to right.
- Finger spell within the area between your shoulders.
- Start your finger spelling from below your chin.
- Spell smoothly and do not bounce or
  move your hand up and down when spelling.
- Relax your hand and wrists, don't strain your wrist.

## How to communicate with Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individuals?

### One-on-one situation

- Get the Deaf person's attention before speaking.
  Call out the person's name.
  If that is not successful,
  a tap on the shoulder, a wave,
  or another visual signal usually does the trick.
- Speak slowly and clearly but don't yell, exaggerate or over pronounce.
- Look directly at the Deaf person when speaking.
- Don't place anything in your mouth when speaking such as chewing gum.
- Avoid standing in front of a light source such as a window or a light bulb.
- Be courteous to the Deaf person during conversation.
  If the telephone or doorbell rings,
  excuse yourself and tell the Deaf person
  you are answering the phone or the door.

### In a group with Deaf people, like in a class or meeting

- Ask the Deaf person to choose the best seating for communication.
  They will know where to sit.
- Provide new vocabulary in advance.
- Use visual aids.
- Slow down the pace of communication slightly.
- Allow full participation by looking out for Deaf people who have questions.
- Repeat questions if the Deaf people look doubtful.

### Using an interpreter

- Use a specialised academic or educational interpreter.
- Abide by the code of ethics to ensure accurate communication
  between people who have different language needs,
  as effective professional practice requires both parties
  to have a clear understanding of each other.
- Treat the interpreter as a professional.
- Speak directly to the Deaf person, and not the interpreter.
- Don't use "tell him / her" when using an interpreter.

## How to introduce yourself to a Deaf person?

When introducing yourself to a Deaf person, be prepared
to include the following in your introduction.

- Your first name and last name.
- Whether you are Deaf, hard of hearing, or hearing.
- Who is teaching you the language and culture.
- Where you are studying.
- Why you are learning the language.

## How to leave a Deaf event?

Do let the Deaf people or organiser know that you are leaving.
You are not being obnoxious, but are instead being polite as they
cannot hear you leaving the room.

## How to know when it is your turn to speak?

In a one-to-one conversation, it is appropriate to watch the signer's face
rather than the hands. Deaf people are generally more accommodating
and after some practice, you will be able to catch the signs through
your peripheral vision.

In a group conversation, you should watch the leading signer.
Try to keep your eyes on the signer. A good strategy of turn taking is to watch
the signer slow down, and you can interrupt without offending him or her.
Alternatively, the signer may pause and look up,
which is the sign for running out of topics, and you can step in.

## Directness

It is known that Deaf people can be very direct.

They can be direct with comments and questions about topics
that hearing people often consider rude. For example, Deaf people don't consider
it rude to make comments such as, "You've really gained weight, what happened?"
In fact, not commenting on an obvious change like weight gain
can come across as aloof or uncaring.

Alternatively, while hearing people might interpret Deaf people's directness
as rude, Deaf people can be confused by how roundabout hearing people can be.
For example, when giving criticism or feedback, hearing people often "pad"
their negative feedback with positive statements.
For Deaf people, this can send mixed messages since it isn't clear what message
the hearing person is trying to convey.

You should speak the same language that Deaf people use and be direct
but be tactful too. There may be some pro-deaf militarist who may not
take a direct response from hearing or Deaf people kindly.

## Being tactful

Being tactful is about showing that you respect the other person's perception.
It is a conversation style that helps you get your needs met while caring about
the impact your message has on people.

Tact is about responding with the skills of sensitivity rather than reacting,
or speaking too soon. First gauge who, what when and where to respond,
then think about how to apply the most tactful response
based on the information.

Observe your emotions and the intensity you are experiencing
about the situation.

All you have to do is pause and **THINK**:

- Is it **True**? Can you identify the facts of the situation?
  Be specific. This helps you avoid misinterpreting situations
  and making subjective judgements.
- Is it **Helpful**? Will this help you deal with this person in the future?
- Is it **Inspiring**? Can you deliver a message as a positive learning
  experience for the other person?
- Is it **Necessary**? Will your message ensure that the person will
  have complete understanding?
- Is it **Kind**? Are you coming from a place of kindness
  and care for all parties?

Once you have done your **THINK**-ing, prepare your response
to the other person. Do not blame, judge, accuse or assume you know
what is motivating the other person. Keep your body language neutral
to reflect the most respectful interpretation of the events.

### Interacting with elderly Deaf people

Unlike interacting with younger Deaf people,
you should not touch elderly Deaf people to get their attention,
as they are easily frightened.
It is best to wave your hand in front of their face to get their attention.

## Visual vernacular (VV)

- Visual vernacular is a theatrical art form of physical expression,
  story-telling with a strong sense of body movements, iconic signs, gestures,
  and facial expressions.
- Visual vernacular has elements of poetry and mime. However, it is totally
  different as it is shown visually such as performing solo or in a group.

5 features of visual vernacular:

1. Long shot and close up to give a distance perspective to the story.
2. Fast and slow motion to slow down or speed up the action to build
   anticipation as the story unfolds.
3. Zooming in and out to gain a variety of perspectives of an object or person.
4. Panoramic view to "set the stage" for the story and develop the story
   environment.
5. Role shifting to show movements, activities, and communications by various
   characters and how they interact with all other characters and in their
   environment in the story.

## Terminology in education for Deaf children at primary level in Singapore

There have been different approaches and communication methods in the education
of Deaf children in Singapore.

### Oral approach

This is an approach to deaf education that emphasises auditory training,
articulation ability and lip-reading. It assumes that all information can be
transmitted by using spoken language. This approach usually excludes the use of
a signed language.

### Manualist approach

This approach makes use of sign language in the classroom. This approach is
very old, and lip-reading and articulation ability are not emphasised.

### Total Communication approach

Total communication approach is a method of interacting with individuals
with language impediments using a combination of spoken language and signs,
which includes sign language, voice, finger-spelling, lip-reading,
amplification, writing, gesturing and visual imagery (pictures).
Signing Exact English (SEE) is used in the Total Communication approach.

### Sign Bilingual / Bicultural approach (Bi-Bi approach)

This is a philosophy of teaching a sign language as a native or first language
of Deaf children and the national written language as a second language.
It recognises the authenticity and importance of both hearing and Deaf cultures,
and that incorporates elements of both in the classroom.

Studies have shown that Deaf students who have higher levels of sign language
profiency also have better results in reading and writing tests
(literacy tests), and perform better in cognitive tasks.

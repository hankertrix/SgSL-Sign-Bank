## Subject and object

Similar to English, every sentence consists of a subject and an object.

- The subject is the person who is doing something (verb or action).

  The main focus of the sentence can either be a person, place, thing, idea,
  or activity.

- Indirect or direct object is the person
  who is receiving something (verb or action).

- Oblique object is the place where the action occurs at.

  The object can be a verb, noun, an adjective or a classifier.

## Basic word order

The basic word order is either subject, verb, object, or subject, object, verb.
For example:

- Little boy chase dog.
- I lost my book.

## Question structure

- The language is very people-centric,
  so questions usually start with the person,
  rather than the 6W (who, what, where, when, why, which)
  and 1H (how) in English.
- The 6W and 1H are usually placed at the end of a sentence.
- Always end a question by doing the gesture for ["you"](../signs/you),
  to indicate that you are waiting for a reply.

## Sentence structure

[Click here for examples](./sentence-structure-examples) of sentence structure.

- Time usually comes first, before everything else.
- The word "will" goes at the end of a sentence.
- When talking about multiple items,
  pick a location for each item and name the locations after the item.
- Make use of the locations of the items when signing.
- Pick the locations in a left-to-right or right-to-left order based on
  your dominant hand.
- Try to minimise the use of adverbs of time and prepositions
  (they are sometimes still needed),
  as sign language has 3 dimensions to express time and location,
  unlike most spoken languages like English,
  which only have a single linear dimension to express both time and location,
  so prepositions and adverbs of time are necessary to order items.

## Verb types

1. Plain verbs

   The signer can't show the indicated verb.

2. Indicating or directional verbs

   The signer is able to show the directional verb toward the second person
   or the third person and vice versa, and between the second and third person.

3. Spatial verbs

   The signer is able to show the location of the spatial verb.

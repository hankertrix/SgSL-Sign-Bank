## Subject and object

Similar to English, every sentence consists of a subject and an object.

- The subject is the person who is doing something (verb or action).

  The main focus of the sentence can either be a person, place, thing, idea,
  or activity.

- Indirect or direct object is the person
  who is receiving something (verb or action).

- Oblique object is the place where the action occurs at.

  The object can be a verb, noun, an adjective or a classifier.

## Basic word order

The basic word order is either subject, verb, object, or subject, object, verb.
For example:

- Little boy chase dog.
- I lost my book.

## Question structure

- The language is very people-centric,
  so questions usually start with the person,
  rather than the 6W (who, what, where, when, why, which)
  and 1H (how) in English.
- Always end a question by doing the gesture for ["you"](../signs/you),
  to indicate that you are waiting for a reply.

## Sentence structure

- When talking about multiple items,
  pick a location for each item and name the locations after the item.
- Make use of the locations of the items when signing.
- Pick the locations in a left-to-right or right-to-left order based on
  your dominant hand.
- Try to minimise the use of adverbs of time and prepositions
  (they are sometimes still needed),
  as sign language has 3 dimensions to express time and location,
  unlike most spoken languages like English,
  which only have a single linear dimension to express both time and location,
  so prepositions and adverbs of time are necessary to order items.

## How to sign more like a native Deaf signer?

- Make your signs as small as reasonably possible.
  Particularly, you should aim to minimise the width of your signs.
- When signing numbers with a [zero](../signs/zero),
  you can just close your fingers into a zero straight away and
  not need to move your hand to the right when signing the zero.
- When signing numbers with a [hundred](../signs/100) in them,
  you can move the "C" backwards instead of to the right.

### Finger spelling tips

- Finger spell from left to right.
- Finger spell within the area between your shoulders.
- Start your finger spelling from below your chin.
- Spell smoothly and do not bounce or
  move your hand up and down when spelling.
- Relax your hand and wrists, don't strain your wrist.

## How to communicate with Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individuals?

### One-on-one situation

- Get the Deaf person's attention before speaking.
  Call out the person's name.
  If that is not successful,
  a tap on the shoulder, a wave,
  or another visual signal usually does the trick.
- Speak slowly and clearly but don't yell, exaggerate or over pronounce.
- Look directly at the Deaf person when speaking.
- Don't place anything in your mouth when speaking such as chewing gum.
- Avoid standing in front of a light source such as a window or a light bulb.
- Be courteous to the Deaf person during conversation.
  If the telephone or doorbell rings,
  excuse yourself and tell the Deaf person
  you are answering the phone or the door.

### In a group with Deaf people, like in a class or meeting

- Ask the Deaf person to choose the best seating for communication.
  They will know where to sit.
- Provide new vocabulary in advance.
- Use visual aids.
- Slow down the pace of communication slightly.
- Allow full participation by looking out for Deaf people who have questions.
- Repeat questions if the Deaf people look doubtful.

### Using an interpreter

- Use a specialised academic or educational interpreter.
- Abide by the code of ethics to ensure accurate communication
  between people who have different language needs,
  as effective professional practice requires both parties
  to have a clear understanding of each other.
- Treat the interpreter as a professional.
- Speak directly to the Deaf person, and not the interpreter.
- Don't use "tell him / her" when using an interpreter.

## How to introduce yourself to a Deaf person?

When introducing yourself to a Deaf person, be prepared
to include the following in your introduction.

- Your first name and last name.
- Whether you are Deaf, hard of hearing, or hearing.
- Who is teaching you the language and culture.
- Where you are studying.
- Why you are learning the language.

## How to leave a Deaf event?

Do let the Deaf people or organiser know that you are leaving.
You are not being obnoxious, but are instead being polite as they
cannot hear you leaving the room.

## How to know when it is your turn to speak?

In a one-to-one conversation, it is appropriate to watch the signer's face
rather than the hands. Deaf people are generally more accommodating
and after some practice, you will be able to catch the signs through
your peripheral vision.

In a group conversation, you should watch the leading signer.
Try to keep your eyes on the signer. A good strategy of turn taking is to watch
the signer slow down, and you can interrupt without offending him or her.
Alternatively, the signer may pause and look up,
which is the sign for running out of topics, and you can step in.

## Directness

It is known that Deaf people can be very direct.

They can be direct with comments and questions about topics
that hearing people often consider rude. For example, Deaf people don't consider
it rude to make comments such as, "You've really gained weight, what happened?"
In fact, not commenting on an obvious change like weight gain
can come across as aloof or uncaring.

Alternatively, while hearing people might interpret Deaf people's directness
as rude, Deaf people can be confused by how roundabout hearing people can be.
For example, when giving criticism or feedback, hearing people often "pad"
their negative feedback with positive statements.
For Deaf people, this can send mixed messages since it isn't clear what message
the hearing person is trying to convey.

You should speak the same language that Deaf people use and be direct
but be tactful too. There may be some pro-deaf militarist who may not
take a direct response from hearing or Deaf people kindly.

## Being tactful

Being tactful is about showing that you respect the other person's perception.
It is a conversation style that helps you get your needs met while caring about
the impact your message has on people.

Tact is about responding with the skills of sensitivity rather than reacting,
or speaking too soon. First gauge who, what when and where to respond,
then think about how to apply the most tactful response
based on the information.

Observe your emotions and the intensity you are experiencing
about the situation.

All you have to do is pause and **THINK**:

- Is it **True**? Can you identify the facts of the situation?
  Be specific. This helps you avoid misinterpreting situations
  and making subjective judgements.
- Is it **Helpful**? Will this help you deal with this person in the future?
- Is it **Inspiring**? Can you deliver a message as a positive learning
  experience for the other person?
- Is it **Necessary**? Will your message ensure that the person will
  have complete understanding?
- Is it **Kind**? Are you coming from a place of kindness
  and care for all parties?

Once you have done your **THINK**-ing, prepare your response
to the other person. Do not blame, judge, accuse or assume you know
what is motivating the other person. Keep your body language neutral
to reflect the most respectful interpretation of the events.

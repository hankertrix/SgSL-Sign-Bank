## Singapore sign language

![Singapore Sign Language](@signs/singapore-sign-language-alphabet.png)

The hand sign for T is slightly different in Singapore Sign Language
compared to American Sign Language,
with the thumb touching the underside of the index finger
instead of the thumb being in between the index and middle finger.

The hand sign for F is also slightly different in Singapore Sign language
compared to American Sign Language,
with the thumb also touching the underside of the index finger,
like in the "T" hand sign, instead of forming an "O"
with your index finger and thumb in American Sign Language.

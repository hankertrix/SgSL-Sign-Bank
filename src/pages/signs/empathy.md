Same gesture as ["understand"](./understand),
but pretend that there is another person
in front of you and do the gesture for
["understand"](./understand) on them.

![Understand](@signs/understand.gif)

This gesture makes a lot of sense since empathy is being able to
understand where the other person is coming from.

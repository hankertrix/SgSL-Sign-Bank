Hold up an index finger with the finger pointing upwards
and the palm facing outwards. Keep this hand stationary.
The index finger on the other hand starts from the same height
as the hand that is stationary, goes up and then down in an arc
before meeting the index finger on the hand that is stationary.

The motion is similar to ["again"](./again).

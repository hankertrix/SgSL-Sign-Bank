## Variation 1

![Variation 1 of run](@signs/run-variation-1.gif)

## Variation 2

Move your hands like you are running.

## Variation 3

Make two "L" hand signs and touch the thumbs together.
Then curl and uncurl the index finger of both hands
while moving your hands forward.

Another way to think of it is to do
the gesture for ["continue"](./continue),
which is shown below,
but curl and uncurl the index fingers of both hands
while moving your hands forward.

## Variation 1

![Variation 1 of Brunei](@signs/brunei-variation-1.gif)

## Variation 2

Have two open palms facing outwards with the fingers pointing upwards,
and make sure the thumb is away from the rest of the fingers.
Tilt both palms such that the fingers are pointing 45 degrees to the side,
then move them together such that both thumbs
and the flesh below the thumbs are touching each other.

## Variation 3

Make two "B" hand signs with both hands.
One hand should be rotated such that the palm is facing the body.
The other hand should have the palm facing downwards.
The hand with the palm facing downwards,
which we will call the moving hand,
should now angle it such that the fingers are pointed 45 degrees upwards
and the middle finger should be at the base of the pinky of the other hand.
The moving hand moves diagonally downwards,
maintaining that 45-degree angle
and rotating the hand clockwise
and anti-clockwise repeatedly as it moves diagonally downwards.

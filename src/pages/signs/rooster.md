## Variation 2

Do the hand gesture for the first variation of
["bird"](./bird#variation-1) once,
which is shown below, and keep the index and thumb touching each other.
Then open the index finger and thumb
and move the hand outwards and to the side.
Open your mouth while doing it as well.
It is to simulate a rooster call in the morning.

## Variation 4

Put your arm in the same position as the gesture for
the first variation of ["autumn"](./autumn#variation-1),
which is shown below.
The other hand does the "V" hand sign
and places both fingers on the elbow,
with the palm facing the elbow.
Then, it rotates upwards such that the palm faces upwards
at the end of the gesture.

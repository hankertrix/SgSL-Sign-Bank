## Variation 1

Hold up two palms facing you, then leave your tongue out while moving
your palms in an ellipse or an oval.
It is basically miming licking the sides of the plate clean.

## Variation 2

Hold up an index finger in front of you with the palm facing forward.
Then, trace an oval or ellipse with your index finger,
before pretending to lick it with your tongue.
It is basically miming using your finger to clean the sauce off a plate
and then licking your finger.

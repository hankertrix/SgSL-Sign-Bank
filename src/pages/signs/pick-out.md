Pick out something from a bunch of other items or someone in a crowd.

Make a "V" hand sign and place it at your eye, with palm facing down,
and fingers pointing forward, then move it from left to right repeatedly
until you find what you are trying to pick out, then raise your eyebrows.

Essentially, you do the gesture for ["glimpse"](./glimpse)
until you find what you were looking for, and then raise your eyebrows.

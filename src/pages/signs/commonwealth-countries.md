The Commonwealth, or the Commonwealth of Nations
is an international association of 56 member states,
most of which are former territories of the British Empire.

Make the ["5"](./5) hand sign on both hands, with all fingers pointing up
and have the thumb touch each other at the side.
Then, draw a vertical circle with the back of the palm,
while rotating the fingers until they are pointing down.

This sign is basically showing the Commonwealth of Nations flag.

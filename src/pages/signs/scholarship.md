## Variation 1

![Scholarship](@signs/scholarship.gif)

The gesture for this sign is pretty much exactly the same as
["passport"](./passport), so the meaning of this sign
likely depends on the context.

## Variation 2

Same gesture as ["support"](./support),
which is shown below, but do it twice.

![Support](@signs/support.gif)

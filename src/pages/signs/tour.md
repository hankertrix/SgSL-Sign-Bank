## Variation 1

## Variation 2

Same hand sign as the gesture for ["word"](./word),
which is shown below, but on the hand that has the index finger and thumb
extended, have them be further apart. Then, move the same hand outwards,
while slowly closing the index finger and thumb
until they are touching each other.

The idea behind the sign is to look like a small flag,
which are usually held by tour guides.

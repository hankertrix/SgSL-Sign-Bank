Place one hand with a closed palm facing towards your body.
We will call this hand the stationary hand.
The other hand forms an "A" hand sign and is positioned to the left
of the thumb of the stationary hand.
We will call this hand the moving hand.
The moving hand then moves in a circular arc around the stationary hand,
while transitioning from the "A" hand sign
to the "B" hand sign at the same time.

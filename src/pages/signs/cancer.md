Hold one arm horizontally with the palm facing down.
The other hand moves from the side of your body
and pretend to grab a pole at wrist of your horizontal arm.
The hand then moves in a horizontal circle
above the wrist of the arm before moving towards the elbow of the arm
and throwing the pole it grabbed to the side.
Then the hand, still an open palm from throwing the pole,
moves back to the side of your body it started from.

## Variation 2

Start with both palm facing upwards,
and with one hand in front of the other,
facing to the side.
Then make a circle by pulling the palms upwards and then back down again,
while transitioning the open palm to the "8" hand sign
with the palm facing downwards at the end of the gesture.

## Variation 2

Make the hand shape for "tough".
Put the curled fingers that form the "hook" together,
with the flat part of the "hook" touching each other,
while making sure the back of the palm faces forward.
Then, move both hands apart
and uncurl the curled fingers that form the "hook",
while also separating the index and middle fingers.

## Variation 1

![Variation 1 of finish](@signs/finish-variation-1.gif)

## Variation 2

Have two palms facing in with the fingers pointing upwards.
Then, rotate your hand such that the palms face outwards.

## Variation 3

This variation is not recommended as it is easily confused
with the [third variation of "lost"](./lost#variation-3).

Same motion as the [second variation](#variation-2),
but have the palms facing down instead of facing outwards.

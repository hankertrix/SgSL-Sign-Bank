## Variation 2

Point upwards with an index finger on one hand
with the palm facing outwards.
The other hand does a "W" hand sign
and place it in front of the index finger pointing upwards,
with the palm facing inwards.
Then, make a claw shape with both hands
and place them in front of you like a tiger prowling.

Make two "F" hand signs with both hands,
then close the circular part of the hand sign
around the other hand's hand sign,
interlocking the two hands at the circular part of the hand sign.
One hand should have its last three fingers pointing forward,
and the other hand should have the last three fingers pointing upwards.

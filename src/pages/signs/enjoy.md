## Variation 2

Make the "T" hand sign with one hand and rub your index finger
against the thumb by moving the index finger up and down the thumb.
It is like rubbing a string between your index finger and thumb.

This sign comes from most Singaporeans having a "臭臭" or "chou chou",
which is a small pillow, usually a baby pillow.
Most of the time, it is not washed, and people would rub
the frays on the fabric on the pillow between their thumb and index finger,
which is what gave rise to this sign.

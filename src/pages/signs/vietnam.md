## Singapore Sign Language variation 2

Do the gesture for the first variation of ["see"](./see#variation-1),
which is shown below,
but move your hand down to the shoulder on the far side
and place your hand there,
roughly where your heart is.
While moving your hand down,
transition from the "V" hand sign to the "N" hand sign.
Your palm should be facing your body
when you have placed your hand on the shoulder on the far side.

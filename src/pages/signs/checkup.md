It isn't necessary to sign "P" hand sign after the "U" in the image above.

## Variation 2

Make a "Y" hand sign and turn it such that the palm is facing towards your body,
and the fingers are pointing towards the side.
Then, make a "V" hand sign with the other hand with the palm facing down,
and the fingers pointing towards the hand with the "Y" hand sign,
and sweep the "V" up and down the "Y" hand sign,
like it is looking over the "Y" hand sign.

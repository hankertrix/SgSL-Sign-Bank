* Concepts, Definitions and Tips

** Agent gesture
[[./images-of-signs/person-variation-a.gif]]

The agent gesture is to show a box with both hands and move the box down.
This gesture used to turn change an action, into a person doing the action. For example, teach + agent gesture = teacher.

[[./images-of-signs/teacher.gif]]

** "Wh" facial expression
This expression is usually used when asking a question, and can be shown as "furrowing" the eyebrows a bit, with the head tilted slightly backwards, and the body leaning towards the respondent.

** Signing area
The signing area refers to the area from the top of your head to the bottom of your waist. The width of that area is shoulder width.

** Tense markers
- Time in sign language is not indicated through tenses, and the verbs in sign language do not change in form when tenses change.
- For example the sign for "eat" and "ate" are the same.
- Time is therefore indicated through the use of adverbs of time.

** Intensity of signs
Intensity is shown by varying the intensity or speed with which a sign is made or by incorporating facial expression. For example:
1. Walk can be made quickly or slowly to indicate how the person is walking.
2. Drink can be modified depending on the volume consumed.
3. Smart becomes brilliant when the sign is exaggerated.
4. Pretty becomes beautiful when the sign is exaggerated.

** Initialised sign
An initialised sign is a sign that uses a letter of the English alphabet in its gesture, usually the first letter of the word.

** Letter drag
You can drag out letters at the end of a finger spell if the ending letters are the same. The motion is like pulling the letter out to the side.

** Plural words
Just repeat the sign once more to show that it is plural.

** Nouns from verbs
Usually, the noun form of a word is just the verb form done twice.

** How to communicate with Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing individuals

*** One-on-one situation
- Get the deaf person's attention before speaking. Call out the person's name. If that is not successful, a tap on the shoulder, a wave, or another visual signal usually does the trick.
- Speak slowly and clearly but don't yell, exaggerate or over pronounce.
- Look directly at the deaf person when speaking.
- Don't place anything in your mouth when speaking such as chewing gum.
- Avoid standing in front of a light source such as a window or a light bulb.
- Be courteous to the deaf person during conversation. If the telephone or doorbell rings, excuse yourself and tell the deaf person you are answering the phone or the door.

*** In a group with deaf people, like in a class or meeting
- Ask the deaf person to choose the best seating for communication. They will know where to sit.
- Provide new vocabulary in advance.
- Use visual aids.
- Slow down the pace of communication slightly.
- Allow full participation by looking out for deaf people who have questions.
- Repeat questions if the deaf people look doubtful.

*** Using an interpreter
- Use a specialised academic or educational interpreter.
- Abide by the code of ethics to ensure accurate communication between people who have different language needs, as effective professional practice requires both parties to have a clear understanding of each other.
- Treat the interpreter as a professional.
- Speak directly to the deaf person, and not the interpreter.
- Don't use "tell him / her" when using an interpreter.

**** Singapore Sign Language Variation 2
Do the gesture for "see", but move your hand down to the shoulder on the far side and place your hand there, roughly where your heart is. While moving your hand down, transition from the "V" hand sign to the "N" hand sign. Your palm should be facing your body when you have placed your hand on the shoulder on the far side.

*** Brunei

**** Variation 1
[[./images-of-signs/brunei-variation-a.gif]]

**** Variation 2
Have two open palms facing outwards with the fingers pointing upwards, and make sure the thumb is outstretched from the rest of the fingers. Tilt both palms such that the fingers are pointing 45 degrees to the side, then move them together such that both thumbs and the flesh below the thumbs are touching each other.

**** Variation 3
Make two "B" hand signs with both hands. One hand should be rotated such that the palm is facing the body. The other hand should have the palm facing downwards. The hand with the palm facing downwards, which we will call the moving hand, should now angle it such that the fingers are pointed 45 degrees upwards and the middle finger should be at the base of the pinky of the other hand. The moving hand moves diagonally downwards, maintaining that 45-degree angle and rotating the hand clockwise and anti-clockwise repeatedly as it moves diagonally downwards.
